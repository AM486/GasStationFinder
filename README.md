# GasStationFinder

##Simple Database Web App for finding gas stations near you.


Gas Station Finder is a web application that was created as a team project for 
the 2015 CE426 Web Technologies course. The purpose of the application is to 
demonstrate a simple example of a web application with database connectivity. 

In the implementation of the project both JSTL and Java Servlet were used to connect
to the Mysql Database. Additionally basic knowledge of the google maps API was necessary
for the demonstration of the points of interest on a map.
